# Ancient Architect

An interactive educational game that teaches <strong>assembly programming concepts</strong> through engaging puzzles in an <strong>ancient architectural setting</strong>. Players learn fundamental computer science concepts by solving visual challenges using assembly-like instructions.

This game is inspired by <strong>Human Resource Machine</strong>, and lead by <strong>Professor Imran Hazra</strong>.
## 🎯 Project Overview

Ancient Architect is designed to bridge the gap between high-level programming concepts and machine-level execution. Through an intuitive visual interface, players solve increasingly complex puzzles using a simplified assembly instruction set, developing crucial computational thinking skills along the way.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Educational Components
- Interactive visual programming environment
- Progressive difficulty levels with unique challenges
- Real-time execution visualization
- Multi-level hint system with contextual assistance
- Achievement system for optimal solutions

### Technical Features
- Custom virtual machine for assembly instruction simulation
- Real-time syntax validation and feedback
- Progress tracking and persistence
- Performance metrics tracking
- AI-powered intelligent assistance

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Vite + React with TypeScript
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Context API with Browser LocalStorage
- **Hosting**: Firebase
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions

Players progress through various levels, each introducing new assembly concepts:

1. **Basic Operations**: Learn INPUT/OUTPUT operations
2. **Control Flow**: Master JUMP instructions
3. **Memory Management**: Utilize COPYFROM/COPYTO commands
4. **Arithmetic**: Implement ADD and SUB operations
5. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional JUMP commands

Each level features:
- Clear objectives and instructions
- Available command set
- Construction area for building programs
- Performance metrics (command count, execution steps)
